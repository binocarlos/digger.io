##Applications
digger.io is very good at making these things called 'apps'.

You have heard of them - there are thousands of them all clamouring for your attention via a little window called 'store' on your smartphone.

Also, it is getting easier to publish these 'apps' using simple HTML ([PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [trigger.io](https://trigger.io/) for example).

	blueprints

	theme
	meta (icon, description etc)
